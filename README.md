### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a recovering CEO, really enjoying a shift into software engineering.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently writing JS snippets for a frontend optimization agency
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in Rust and Substrate
- ğŸ¤– I've pinned some software projects I did below:
  - ğŸ‘¾ temp_monitor was a Raspberry Pi-based temperature monitoring system I built for a walkin cooler in a commercial kitchen that I own
  - ğŸ‘¾ food_for_thought was a Python-based webapp (flask, mysql, uwsgi, docker) that I made for an office catering company I started with a friend
